# Reverse-Shell-Malware
Client and server side python to create and maintain a connection to a machine

The aim of this project is to create a trojan which establishes a connection within a target machine that allows the attacker to execute commands remotely.
It is given that the victim has downloaded the code, and is going to run it with administrative permissions, as many users are easily willing to do so.

Currently, the code will only function on Linux, and only on Debian based systems, however I am working on expanding this to all common Linux platforms, as well as MacOS potentially. Ideally, I'd be able to run this on Windows too, however running commands on Windows through a shell is very restrictive.

This code is a form of basic malware, so please check the laws in your country before running it on any machine. It is likely that you will need permission from the owner of the target machine to run the code on it, otherwise you could be breaking the law.

I can't guarantee that these files won't harm your computer, even though they don't harm mine, so if you're unsure, run them in a virtual environment first.
